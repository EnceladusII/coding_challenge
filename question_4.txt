Binding affinity between a protein and a ligand describes the strength of the ligand's binding to a protein. It can be measured and characterized by the binding free energy or Kd calculation, which is determined by various biochemical interactions (non-bonded interactions, hydrogen bonds, Lennard-Jones interactions, etc.). In our case, we compare the experimental ligand binding with two docking prediction methods using the calculation of the symmetry-corrected root mean square deviation. However, experimental structures like X-ray crystallography determine a single structure in one conformation (protein structures are entropic), and a ligand can have different binding locations or conformations in a protein's binding site. Moreover, crystallographic structures may not represent the true biological structure due to the crystallization protocol. Therefore, these metrics do not provide information about the dissociation constant, and Kd is an essential parameter for evaluating binding affinity. It give information of how many concentration is require to have a binding reaction.
